# client-server-TCP-socket-program

This project demonstrates a simple client-server application using socket programming in Python. The client sends messages to the server, which processes and returns the messages in uppercase.

## Instructions for Windows:

1. Ensure Python is installed on your Windows machine. If not, download and install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

2. Save the `client.py` and `server.py` files in a directory on your Windows machine.

3. Open Command Prompt:
    - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.

4. Navigate to the directory where the Python files are saved using the `cd` command.

5. Run the server:
    ```
    python server.py
    ```

6. Open a new Command Prompt window for the client:
    - Repeat step 3 to open a new Command Prompt window.

7. Run the client:
    ```
    python client.py
    ```

8. Follow the prompts in the client program to send messages to the server and view the processed messages.

## Instructions for Mac:

1. Verify that Python is installed on your Mac. If not, install Python using Homebrew or download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

2. Save the `client.py` and `server.py` files in a directory on your Mac.

3. Open Terminal:
    - You can find Terminal in the Applications > Utilities folder, or search for it using Spotlight.

4. Navigate to the directory where the Python files are saved using the `cd` command.

5. Run the server:
    ```
    python server.py
    ```

6. Open a new Terminal tab for the client:
    - Go to `Shell` > `New Tab` in the Terminal menu.

7. Run the client:
    ```
    python client.py
    ```

8. Interact with the client program to send and receive messages from the server.

**Note:** Ensure that the server is running before starting the client to establish a connection.
